# 🌎 Climate Change Beliefs and Extreme Weather Events  
**BI 410: Data Visualization for Biology**

## Overview
This project was completed for **BI 410: Data Visualization for Biology** and focuses on the visual exploration of relationships between **public beliefs about climate change** and **extreme weather events** in the United States.

The goal of the project was not formal hypothesis testing, but rather to use **data visualization and data manipulation** to explore patterns, trends, and potential correlations between climate-related experiences and public perception.

---

## Research Focus
This project explores questions such as:

- Do public beliefs about climate change change over time?
- Are increases in extreme weather events associated with increases in climate change belief or concern?
- How do political views and demographics relate to climate change perceptions?

## Data Sources

### Climate Change Belief Data
- **Source:** Yale Program on Climate Change Communication & George
Mason University Center for Climate Change
- **Type:** Public survey data  
- **Content Includes:**
  - Belief in climate change
  - Perceived personal and societal impacts
  - Support for climate-related policies
  - Voting preferences and demographic information

### Extreme Weather Data
- **Source:** NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)  
- **Type:** Observational climate data  
- **Content Includes:**
  - Frequency of extreme weather events
  - Event types (e.g., freezes, floods, storms)
  - Temporal alignment with survey years

---

## Methods

### Data Processing
- Cleaning and formatting survey and climate datasets
- Aligning datasets by time period
- Aggregating extreme weather events for comparison with survey data

### Visualization
- Time-series visualizations of climate beliefs
- Comparisons of belief trends alongside extreme weather frequency
- Exploratory visual comparisons rather than statistical testing

**Note:**  
This project emphasizes *visual pattern discovery* rather than formal statistical inference.

## Tools & Technologies
- R
- haven, tidyverse, anytime, labelled
- ggplot
- R Studio

---

## Limitations
- Observational and self-reported survey data
- No formal statistical hypothesis testing performed
- Temporal correlation does not imply causation
- Survey responses may be influenced by media coverage and political context

---

## Files & Organization
- Notebooks focus on data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
- Figures are designed to communicate trends and comparisons clearly
